| Rank | Project | Language | Short Summary |
|:----:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
| 00 | [libft](https://github.com/stevebalk/libft) | C | Libft - This project is about to write our own version of a set of functions from the standard libc and also some that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form. |
| 01 | [ft_printf](https://github.com/stevebalk/ft_printf) | C | ft_printf - This project is about to write our own printf function by understanding and using variadic functions. |
| 01 | [get_next_line](https://github.com/stevebalk/get_next_line) | C | get_next_line - This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. |
| 02 | [pipex](https://github.com/stevebalk/pipex) | C |  pipex - This project is about to learn and implement the concepts of redirections, pipes, child and parent processes. |
| 02 | [push_swap](https://github.com/stevebalk/push_swap) | C | push_swap - This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. |
| 02 | [fdf](https://github.com/stevebalk/fdf) | C | fdf - This project is the first graphical project and is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines (wireframe model) by unsing the 42 school graphical library: the MiniLibX!. |
| 03 | [minishell](https://github.com/stevebalk/minishell) | C |  minishell - This project involves creating a simplified version of a Unix shell. |
| 03 | [philosophers](https://github.com/stevebalk/Philosophers) | C | philosophers - This project is about learning the basics of threading a process, creating threads and mutexes.|
| 04 | [cub3D](https://github.com/stevebalk/cub3d) | C | cub3D - This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game Wolfenstein 3D. It is about configuration file and map parsing, ray-casting principles, efficient use of the mlx library for graphics, handling keyboard and mouse events for navigation, and texture mapping for wall surfaces. |
| 04 | [CPP00](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP00) | C++ | CPP00 - This is the first module of C++ and designed to understand the specifities of the language compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming! The module is about Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff. |
| 04 | [CPP01](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP01) | C++ | CPP01 - Module about memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statement. |
| 04 | [CPP02](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP02) | C++ | CPP02 - Module about ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form. |
| 04 | [CPP03](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP03) | C++ | CPP03 - Module about Inheritance. |
| 04 | [CPP04](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP04) | C++ | CPP04 - Module about subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces. |
| 05 | [CPP05](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP05) | C++ | CPP05 - Module about to understand Try/Catch and Exceptions. |
| 05 | [CPP06](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP06) | C++ | CPP06 - Module about the different cast types. |
| 05 | [CPP07](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP07) | C++ | CPP07 - Module about Templates. |
| 05 | [CPP08](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP08) | C++ | CPP08 - Module about templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP. |
| 05 | [CPP09](https://github.com/stevebalk/42_CPP_modules/tree/master/CPP09) | C++ | CPP09 - Module about to choose which container fits best for a given scenario implementing the Ford-Johnson algorithms. |
| 05 | [WebServ](https://github.com/wrottger/webserv) | C++ | WebServ - Create a whole C++ Webserver from scratch (Conforming to the RFC HTTP 1.1 Standard). The server also supports the Common Gateway Interface for script execution.
| 05 | inception | Docker + Dockercompose | tbd |
| 06 | ft_transcendence | C++ | tbd |
